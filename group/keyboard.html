    <h1>Keyboard</h1>
    <p style="width: 520px;"> A standard keyboard has 108 keys, plus 4 shell parts (top, bottom, 2 support legs) an
        interior circuit board, an attachment cable, a rubberized key mount for each key, 4–6 rubber “feet" on the
        bottom and possibly a usb port soldered to the circuit board. That works out to around 228 individual parts. A
        keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer. Like an electric
        typewriter, a keyboard is composed of buttons to create letters, numbers, and symbols, and perform additional
        functions. The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to frequently asked questions
        about the keyboard.</p>

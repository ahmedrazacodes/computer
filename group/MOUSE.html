    <p style="width: 520px;">Development of the mouse began in the early 1960s by SRI International's Douglas Engelbart,
        while he was exploring the interactions between humans and computers.</p>

    <h3>History of Mouse</h3>
    <p style="width: 520px;">A computer mouse (plural mice, also mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held pointing device that
        detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of the
        pointer (called a <a href="/group/image/cursor.png">cursor)</a> on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a
        computer.

        The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was done by Doug Engelbart in 1968 as
        part of the Mother of All Demos.[1] Mice originally used two separate wheels to directly track movement across a
        surface: one in the x-dimension and one in the Y. Later, the standard design shifted to use a ball rolling on a
        surface to detect motion, in turn connected to internal rollers. Most modern mice use optical movement detection
        with no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable, many modern mice are
        cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.</p>

    <h3>What is LCD?</h3>
    <p style="width: 520px;">LCD is a flat panel display technology commonly used in TVs and computer monitors. LCDs were a big leap in terms of the technology they replaced, which include light-emitting diode (LED) and gas-plasma displays. LCDs allowed displays to be much thinner than cathode ray tube (CRT) technology. LCDs consume much less power than LED and gas-display displays because they work on the principle of blocking light rather than emitting it. Where an LED emits light, the liquid crystals in an LCD produces an image using a backlight.

        As LCDs have replaced older display technologies, LCDs have begun being replaced by new display technologies such as OLEDs.</p>

        <h3>The history of liquid-crystal display</h3>
        <P style="width: 520PX;">Liquid crystals play in many ways a considerable and ever increasing role in our lives. Their first application celebrates a big birthday: In 1968, the invention of the first liquid crystal display (LCD) marks the origin of a whole new generation of technical devices. Learn more about half a century full of creativity â€“ a fascinating history which surely will have more in store for us in the future.</P>
